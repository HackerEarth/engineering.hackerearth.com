40,000+ programmers use HackerEarth. Everyday, people from all over India and
other countries submit code on HackerEarth, solve problems and participate in
online coding tests. Our
[CodeFactory server](http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2013/03/12/100000-strong) 
has processed over
500,000 requests till now. There are different types of
[challenges](http://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/) running
every month. The [technology stack](http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2013/03/20/hackerearth-technology-stack)
consists of multiple servers of different
types e.g. search-server, realtime-server, web-server, log-server, etc.
running at any time. Over 100,000 lines of code are running to serve your
requests, and we [deploy a dozen times everyday](http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2013/08/05/continuous-deployment-system).

And we have been able to achieve that with relatively very high uptime all along.
To make this possible, we have written many monitoring services for our
backend. The public status page listing few of the services is now publicly
available at [http://status.hackerearth.com/](http://status.hackerearth.com/).

To make it even more interesting, we are making the data collected by status
monitoring services public. All the data is in JSON format, they are over
800,000 in number, and they are
available in a schema-less database - [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/).
Are you curious how that data looks like? There might be
[gold-rush](http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/HvkkJnjacsQ/maxresdefault.jpg) in there, and
we invite you to find that gold, to find something interesting out of the data
and show what you can do with that in hand. There are umpteen stories to
uncover, you just need to dig!

###Data Access

The data is available in JSON format in RethinkDB. Following are the details of
host, database and table:

* Endpoint: **status-data-challenge.hackerearth.com**
* Port: 80
* Database name: careerstack
* Tables
  * **hackerearth_status**: for [HackerEarth webserver](http://www.hackerearth.com/)
  * **api_status**: for [HackerEarth API](http://developer.hackerearth.com/)
  * **realtime_status**: for [Realtime server](http://realtime.hackerearth.com/ping/)
  * **code_checker_status**: for CodeChecker server
  * **celery_status**: for task queue
  * **rabbitmq_status**: for message queue
* Web UI: [http://status-data-challenge.hackerearth.com:8080/](http://status-data-challenge.hackerearth.com:8080/)

To get started, you need to
[install rethinkdb-client drivers](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install-drivers/)
on your machine. 

The query language is very simple and easy to get. You should go through
[RethinkDB QL](http://rethinkdb.com/api/#py) for getting started with the
database query.

Below is a sample Python code for reading hackerearth_status table:

{% highlight python %}
import rethinkdb as r

# connect to rethinkdb
r.connect(host='status-data-challenge.hackerearth.com', db='careerstack', port=80).repl()

# get first 10 JSON data from hackerearth_status table
data = r.table('hackerearth_status').slice(0, 10).run()

for d in data:
    print d
{% endhighlight %}

It prints following output in the console:

{% highlight text %}

{u'status': 200, u'response_received_time': 1374929387.17773, u'message': u'OK', u'request_time': 1374929387.126168, u'id': u'000b81e6-2e7e-491f-906a-c818c95a96f1'}

{% endhighlight %}

The data format varies a little for *code_checker_status*,
*celery_status*, and *rabbitmq_status*. They have more key-value data in message.

You might have noticed, these are the following primary key-value pairs:
* *id*: Unique identifier for the JSON document
* *status*: Status code returned from the service
* *message*: Message returned from the service ping-pong
* *request_time*: Number of seconds since epoch when the service was pinged
* *response_received_time*: Number of seconds since epoch when the service responded

You might have realized that *response_received_time - request_time* is the service latency.

To see the data stored in *code_checker_status* table, copy-paste the following script in 
the [Data Explore in Web UI](http://status-data-challenge.hackerearth.com:8080/#dataexplorer)
and hit 'Run'.

{% highlight python %}
r.db('careerstack').table('code_checker_status').slice(0, 1)
{% endhighlight %}

The data explorer and Web UI is completely exposed. This means anyone can
delete the data too. But you are not advised to do so. In any case, the data is
restored to original state every 10 minutes using a periodic asynchronous task.

Quering data is very easy and intuitive in RethinkDB in multiple languages.
For creating visualizaton in the frontend, we recommend using [d3js](http://d3js.org/),
a very good JavaScript library for creating graphs and other visualizations. You can read
the basic tutorials [here](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/).

###To Enter Data Challenge

You have to host your code repository on Github and send a link to the repository along
with images of your graph(s), table(s), or any other data analysis to *vivek@hackerearth.com*
