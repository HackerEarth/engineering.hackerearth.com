Earlier in 2016, I came up with the idea of creating a Python module which could provide functionality of profiling
functions w.r.t. SQL queries and tell exactly at what lines of function, the queries were happening.
I called that package **Goofy** and created it with the engineering of Python AST manipulation.
You can read the post on it [here](/2016/02/01/profiling-django-views/) later.
It helped us profiling views serving AJAX requests but it had some limitations too. E.g. we
couldn't see the whole callstack trace of the queries and couldn't analyze the
queries.

In an internal hackathon @HackerEarth which happened in Nov 2017, I revisited this problem
and tried to come up with a profiler, through which we could see the stats on
front-end and which should be much lightweight and would work with AJAX requests.
I named this package **Scooby**.


## Idea

We have been using the package **django-debug-toolbar**, but it wasn't enough
because it didn't have the functionality of profiling AJAX requests.
And because of the size of our codebase, it had made serving web pages slower in develop mode
because it injects the stats in HTML by rendering and rendering takes time.
So we needed an alternative.

The idea while creating the **Scooby** package was to have a similar type of package
as of django-debug-toolbar but instead of rendering the stats to HTML, we can dump the
stats data to some backend store e.g. Redis where it will reside temporarily.
And show the stats on front-end using a chrome extension.


## Implementation

We had to create a Python/Django package for backend and a npm package for
front-end which would build the chrome-extension. We took the decision of using
**ReactJS** as rendering framework for the chrome-extension.

In backend, we just had to create and put a new middleware which will do the job of collecting
profiled stats for different plugins (E.g. SQL, Memcache etc.) and put
the stats to Redis against some UUID as key. We would put that key as value of a
custom header (`X-Scooby`) in HTTP response, so that chrome-extension could collect stats for
that request-response later using that key.

The chrome-extension would put a hook to network calls in browser and
whenever a response comes for a request, check if the
response has that custom header which contains the UUID. If yes, then collect
the data from url `/scooby/get-data/<uuid>/` in same domain.

This is the code of middleware
(You can skip directly to [Further improvements](#improvements) section if you are not interested in code):

```python
import uuid

from .base import ScoobyData
from .utils import get_redis


class ScoobyMiddleware(object):
    def process_request(self, request):
        request.scooby_data = ScoobyData()
        request.scooby_data.on_process_request(request)

    def process_view(self, request, view, view_args, view_kwargs):
        request.scooby_data.on_process_view(
            request, view, view_args, view_kwargs)

    def process_response(self, request, response):
        request.scooby_data.on_process_response(request, response)
        unique_hex = uuid.uuid4().hex
        response['X-Scooby'] = unique_hex
        # Set data in redis for 10 minutes.
        redis = get_redis()
        redis.set(unique_hex, request.scooby_data.as_json(), 600)
        return response
```

And this is how `ScoobyData` class is defined. For each stage of middleware
(`process_request`, `process_view` and `process_response`),
it deferred to all available plugins so that those could collect their respective data on their own.

```python
import json

from .plugin_finder import get_plugins

class ScoobyData(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = get_plugins() # Instances of different plugin classes.
        self.plugins_data = {}
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            self.plugins_data[plugin.name] = plugin.Data()

    def on_process_request(self, request):
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            plugin_data = self.plugins_data[plugin.name]
            plugin.on_process_request(plugin_data, request)

    def on_process_view(self, request, view, view_args, view_kwargs):
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            plugin_data = self.plugins_data[plugin.name]
            plugin.on_process_view(plugin_data, request,
                                   view, view_args, view_kwargs)

    def on_process_response(self, request, response):
        for plugin in self.plugins:
            plugin_data = self.plugins_data[plugin.name]
            plugin.on_process_response(plugin_data, request, response)

    def as_json(self):
        plugins_data_json = {}
        for plugin_name in self.plugins_data:
            plugin_data = self.plugins_data[plugin_name]
            plugins_data_json[plugin_name] = plugin_data.as_json_dict()
        return json.dumps({
            'plugins_data': plugins_data_json
        })
```

Here is the code of a very simple plugin which would collect data regarding
which view was hit and what all `args` and `kwargs` were passed to it:

```python
class ViewNamePluginData(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.view_name = None
        self.args = ()
        self.kwargs = {}

    def as_json_dict(self):
        return {
            'view_name': self.view_name,
            'args': self.args,
            'kwargs': self.kwargs,
        }

class ViewNamePlugin(object):
    Data = ViewNamePluginData

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = 'ViewName'

    def on_process_request(self, request):
        pass

    def on_process_view(self, plugin_data, request,
                        view, view_args, view_kwargs):
        plugin_data.view_name = '%s.%s' % (view.__module__, view.__name__)
        plugin_data.args = view_args
        plugin_data.kwargs = view_kwargs

    def on_process_response(self, request, response):
        pass
```

This has been the generic way of adding new plugins, and collecting/serving
data regarding those plugins.
We added the plugin for SQL queries with same pattern.


## <a id="improvements"></a>Further improvements

After this was build in hackathon, there have been many additions to this package later on.

1. We added the plugins for queries happening in **Memcache** and **Thriftpy** along
with **SQL**.
2. Added a plugin for raw Python **cProfiler** using which you could cProfile
your views with just enabling it in chrome-extension. You don't need to put
temporary code for cProfiling views anymore.
3. Added the option to enable profiling on front-end instead of always
   collecting/dumping data on backend. This way there is no overhead of this
   profiler on backend when you are not using the chrome-extension.
4. Added a logger with scooby package too which would behave
alternative to `print`/`logger.debug` for debugging purposes. With this new
logger you wouldn't have to look into console but instead look into the chrome
extension in browser for those logs. Here's how you can do that:

```python
import scooby
scooby.log("foo", "bar")
```

## Screenshot

Here is the screenshot of how SQL queries look in chrome-extension.
<img src='/images/scooby-ext-screenshot.png' />

In the right panel under **SQL** tab, you can see stacktraces of all different queries.
There is an option to group all similar queries together. Let's say if you are
making same type of sql query in a for loop, just few parameters are changed in
different queries. By grouping them together you can see the count of those and 
also see how much total time those took. By this, N+1 query proplems are
analyzed.

## Open sourcing it

Both backend and front-end packages of **Scooby profiler** are open-sourced.

If you are using Django as the backend framework, give this profiler a try.
We would be glad to hear the feedback.

* The Python package is available in PYPI as name of
`django-scooby-profiler`. This is the github link
[https://github.com/shhaumb/django-scooby-profiler](https://github.com/shhaumb/django-scooby-profiler).
That page contains the documentation of how you can integrate it with your
project.
* The chome extension is available in chrome web store
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scooby-profiler/kicgfdanpohconjegfkojbpceodecjad](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scooby-profiler/kicgfdanpohconjegfkojbpceodecjad).
