We had already published HackerEarth API v1 in February, 2012 at
[http://developer.hackerearth.com](http://developer.hackerearth.com).
The API v1 was synchronous
in nature. This means that your request kept hanging until the
code evaluation was done and response was received. This seriously
limited anyone from writing robust applications using the API.

We have been using the *asynchronous API* for a long time ourselves
at HackerEarth for processing all the code submissions. It's fast,
it's robust and works flawlessly. Today, we are making the async
API public.

There is not a major change in the way API request is done, if you have
already checked out the synchronous API v1. Now, you
get a confirmation response as soon as you do the request. The actual response
containing the code evaluation data arrives later at the callback as
POST data, with the response contained in 'payload' POST parameter.
The response format is always same and in JSON format.

<br>
Below is a technical description of how the Asynchronous API works.

The API defines the following endpoints:

    http://api.hackerearth.com/code/compile/
    http://api.hackerearth.com/code/run/

<br>
If you haven't already got your secret key, [register here](http://www.hackerearth.com/api/register/).

To make an asynchronous request, now you just need to pass 1 as a value
to 'async' parameter, along with other required parameters. 

    {% highlight python%}
    {% raw %}
    import urllib

    COMPILE_URL = 'http://api.hackerearth.com/code/compile/'
    RUN_URL = 'http://api.hackerearth.com/code/run/'

    CLIENT_SECRET = '5db3f1c12c59caa1002d1cb5757e72c96d969a1a'

    source = open('sample.c').read()
    lang = 'C'

    post_data = {
        'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET,
        
        # Asynchronous mode on
        'async': 1,

        'source': source,
        'lang': lang,
        'time_limit': 5,
        'memory_limit': 262144,

        # Id to keep track of request
        'id': 123,

        # Callback URL where processed response will later arrive
        # - this response is same as the response received in
        # synchronous API request.
        'callback': 'http://example.com/receive-hackerearth-response/'
    }

    post_data = urllib.urlencode(post_data)

    response = urllib.urlopen(RUN_URL, post_data)
    print "post_data: ",post_data
    print
    print response.read()
    {% endraw %}
    {% endhighlight %}

<br>
Output from the above script is:

    post_data:  lang=C&source=%23include+%3Cstdio.h%3E%0A%0Aint+main%28%29+%7B%0A++++printf%28%22Hello%22%29%3B%0A++++int+n%3B%0A++++scanf%28%22%25d%22%2C+%26n%29%3B%0A++++printf%28%22%5Cn%25d%5Cn%22%2C+n%29%3B%0A++++return+0%3B%0A%7D%0A&callback=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Freceive-hackerearth-response%2F&async=1&time_limit=5&client_secret=4df77c2c2eb62f9adb20bd1127f6f44a4ce6cda4&id=123&memory_limit=262144

    {"errors": {}, "code_id": "3d255bX", "id": 123, "message": "OK", "run_status": {"status": "NA", "time_limit": 5, "async": 1, "memory_limit": 262144}, "compile_status": "Compiling...", "web_link": "http://code.hackerearth.com/3d255bX"}

<br>
In the asynchronous API, 'id' and 'callback' are mandatory parameters.
'id' is given by client and is returned in the response. It's also returned
in the response sent later at callback URL. You might have noticed the following
map in the JSON response:

    "run_status": {"status": "NA", "time_limit": 5, "async": 1, "memory_limit": 262144}
    "compile_status": "Compiling..."

<br>
The *run_status.status* emits 'NA', which means the result is not yet available.
The *compile_status* shows 'Compiling...' which means the code compilation has started.

The processing of response received at callback URL given by you in API request
can be done as following:

    {% highlight python %}
    import json

    def api_response(request):
        payload = request.POST.get('payload', '') 
        
        """
        This payload is in JSON format. You need to load it using
        native method to convert it into dictionary for easy operations
        later on.
        """
        payload = json.loads(payload)
        print payload

        """
        {u'errors': {}, u'code_id': u'3d255bX', u'web_link': u'http://code.hackerearth.com/3d255bX', u'compile_status': u'OK', u'id': u'123', u'async': 1, u'run_status': {u'status': u'AC', u'memory_used': u'64', u'output_html': u'Hello<br>1</br>', u'time_used': u'0.1006', u'signal': u'OTHER', u'status_detail': u'N/A', u'output': u'Hello\\n1\\n'}, u'message': u'OK'}
        """

        run_status = payload.get('run_status')
        o = run_status['output']
        print o

        """
        Hello
        1
        """
        return HttpResponse('API Response Recieved!')
    {% endhighlight %}

<br>
The data is received as POST request, and the JSON response is contained in
*payload* key of POST request dictionary. *request.POST.get('payload')*
returns the JSON response.

    {u'errors': {}, u'code_id': u'3d255bX', u'web_link': u'http://code.hackerearth.com/3d255bX', u'compile_status': u'OK', u'id': u'123', u'async': 1, u'run_status': {u'status': u'AC', u'memory_used': u'64', u'output_html': u'Hello<br>1</br>', u'time_used': u'0.1006', u'signal': u'OTHER',u'status_detail': u'N/A', u'output': u'Hello\\n1\\n'}, u'message': u'OK'}

<br>
*payload* has *id* that was sent in the request.
This way you can keep track of the response received at
the callback URL from client side and which response
came for which request if you are sending many requests in batch.
*payload* also contains the full information about *run_status* and
*compile_status* giving you all the data about code evaluation.

Asynchronous API has many advantages with no limit on number of requests per
second. You can also build your own website for code evaluation just using
the API. If you haven still not got your secret key,

Now build something interesting and dazzle the world :)
